      Scrolling or Doom Scrolling through news feeds or social media in the current digital era can easily cause one to lose track of time. What begins as a brief check for updates frequently escalates into hours of reading upsetting stories and depressing headlines. Doom scrolling is a recent habit that has gradually spread throughout society and negatively impacts people's concentration, mental health, and general well-being. The never-ending barrage of negative news, from international crises to regional tragedies, can leave many people trapped in a cycle of anxiety and information overload.

        <p>
        Although it's crucial to stay informed, too much exposure to bad news can be detrimental to one's mental health. By inducing the body's cortisol response, doomscrolling keeps the brain on high alert, increasing stress and anxiety. Additionally, it interferes with sleep and concentration because blue light and late-night scrolling make it difficult to unwind and concentrate during the day.

        Over time, consuming distressing content can lead to emotional exhaustion, hopelessness, and numbness. The more people engage in doomscrolling, the darker the world can seem, trapping them in a cycle of seeking reassurance through more news—only to end up feeling worse.

          <h3>Ways to Prevent Doom Scrolling</h3>

          <p>
            The first step to breaking the doomscrolling cycle is to be aware of it. Set clear limits first. Decide when and for how long each day you will check social media or the news. Don't use screens before bed, and turn off notifications that aren't needed to make room for sleep and focus.
          </p>

            Next, choose what you see in your feeds on purpose. Instead of following accounts that are always negative, follow ones that share positive, creative, or educational content. Instead of mindlessly scrolling, do something that calms you down, like writing in a journal, reading, or going for a walk. Lastly, practice mindful consumption by asking yourself if the information you're looking at is useful or just making you anxious. Knowing when to unplug lets you stay up to date without getting too stressed out.
